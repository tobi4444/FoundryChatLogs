Mending
	
 
	
	
	
	This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.

Chromatic Orb
	
 
	
	
	
	You hurl a 4-inch-diameter sphere of energy at a creature that you can see within range. You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes  3d8 damage of the type you chose. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by  1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

Ice Knife
	
 
	
	
	
	You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes  1d10 piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take  2d6 cold damage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by  1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

Tidal Wave
	
 
	
	
	
	You conjure up a wave of water that crashes down on an area within range. The area can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes  4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within 30 feet of it, and then it vanishes.

	Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

Call Lightning - Circle Spell
	
 
	
	
	
	A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes  3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by  1d10. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by  1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

This spell's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level ( 2d12), 11th level ( 3d12), and 17th level ( 4d12).

Ice Knife
	
 
	
	
	
	You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes  1d10 piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take  2d6 cold damage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by  1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

Eldritch Blast A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.
The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

Healing Spirit
	
 
	
	
	
	You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore  1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by  1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

Ice Knife
	
 
	
	
	
	You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes  1d10 piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take  2d6 cold damage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by  1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

Suggestion You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

Booming Blade
	
 
	
	
	
	As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes  1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra  1d8 thunder damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to  2d8. Both damage rolls increase by  1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

	You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes  1d10 piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take  2d6 cold damage. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by  1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

Natural Recovery
	
 
	
	
	
	The druid can recover this number worth of spell slots (of 5th level or lower):
	Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long restFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

Erupting Earth
	
 
	
	
	
	Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes  3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by  1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.

Call Lightning - Circle Spell
	
 
	
	
	
	A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes  3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by  1d10. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by  1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

Wand of Entangle
	
 
	
	
	
	
Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

1 lb.
 




This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the entangle spell (save DC 13) from it.
The wand regains  1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a  d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

	You hurl a 4-inch-diameter sphere of energy at a creature that you can see within range. You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes  3d8 damage of the type you chose. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by  1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

Booming Blade
	
 
	
	
	
	As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes  1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra  1d8 thunder damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to  2d8. Both damage rolls increase by  1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

Produce Flame
	
 
	
	
	
	A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes  1d8 fire damage.This spell's damage increases by  1d8 when you reach 5th level ( 2d8), 11th level ( 3d8), and 17th level ( 4d8).

	You summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:One beast of challenge rating 2 or lowerTwo beasts of challenge rating 1 or lowerFour beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lowerEight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lowerEach beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.The DM has the creatures' statistics. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.

	You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals  1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.

Produce Flame
	
 
	
	
	
	A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes  1d8 fire damage.This spell's damage increases by  1d8 when you reach 5th level ( 2d8), 11th level ( 3d8), and 17th level ( 4d8).

Produce Flame
	
 
	
	
	
	A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes  1d8 fire damage.This spell's damage increases by  1d8 when you reach 5th level ( 2d8), 11th level ( 3d8), and 17th level ( 4d8).

	When a creature the dream wraith can see starts its turn within 30 feet of the dream wraith, the dream wraith can create the illusion that it looks like that creature's most recently departed loved one. If the creature can see the dream wraith, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of its turn.

Flaming Sphere
	
 
	
	
	
	A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes  2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by  1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

Wild Shape
	
 
	
	
	
	Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.Beast ShapesLevelMax. CRLimitationsExample2nd1/4No flying or swimming speedWolf4th1/2No flying speedCrocodile8th1—Giant eagleYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.While you are transformed, the following rules apply:Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

Booming Blade
	
 
	
	
	
	As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes  1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra  1d8 thunder damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to  2d8. Both damage rolls increase by  1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

Flaming Sphere
	
 
	
	
	
	A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes  2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by  1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

Frostbite
	
 
	
	
	
	You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes  1d6 cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.The spell's damage increases by  1d6 when you reach 5th level ( 2d6), 11th level ( 3d6), and 17th level ( 4d6).

Plant Growth - Circle Spell
	
 
	
	
	
	This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
